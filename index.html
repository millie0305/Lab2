        <h1>Edgar Allen Poe</h1>
        <h2>Ulalume</h2>
        <paragraph>Thus I pacified Psyche and kissed her,
            <br>And tempted her out of her gloom—
            <br>And conquered her scruples and gloom;
            <br>And we passed to the end of the vista,
            <br>But were stopped by the door of a tomb—
            <br>By the door of a legended tomb;
            <br>And I said: "What is written, sweet sister,
            <br>On the door of this legended tomb?"
            <br>She replied: "Ulalume -Ulalume—
            <br>'Tis the vault of thy lost Ulalume!"
