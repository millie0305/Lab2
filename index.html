        <h1>Two Poems of Edgar Allen Poe</h1>
        <h2>Ulalume</h2>
        <paragraph>Thus I pacified Psyche and kissed her,
            <br>And tempted her out of her gloom—
            <br>And conquered her scruples and gloom;
            <br>And we passed to the end of the vista,
            <br>But were stopped by the door of a tomb—
            <br>By the door of a legended tomb;
            <br>And I said: <em>"What is written, sweet sister,
            <br>On the door of this legended tomb?"</em>
            <br>She replied: <strong>"Ulalume -Ulalume—</strong>
            <br>'Tis the vault of thy lost <strong><em>Ulalume!"</em></strong>

        <h2>Lenore</h2>
        <paragraph>"Avaunt! to-night my heart is light. No dirge will I upraise,
            <br>"But waft the angel on her flight with a Pæan of old days!
            <br>"Let no bell toll!--lest her sweet soul, amid its hallowed mirth,
            <br>"Should catch the note, as it doth float up from the damnéd Earth.
            <br>"To friends above, from fiends below, the indignant ghost is riven--
            <br>"From Hell unto a high estate far up within the Heaven--
            <br>"From grief and groan, to a golden throne, beside the King of Heaven."
